deepametha-to-libremap-bridge
=============================

this one provides an ad-hoc module for the DeepaMetha Framework, connectig to the libremaps couchDBs.
It will be able to utilize the same router databases, rendering the connected Nodes from the prospect of Neo4j, a graphoriented database.

###Goals of "deepametha-to-libremap-bridge":
* show the state of all community networks, both on a global and local scale.
* independent of involved routing protocols.
* share open data for community networks.
* extend the functionality of the DeepaMetha Framework


###Installation


###Bugs and feature requests
I appreciate any suggestion or help 

I get inspired or use code of following projects

###LibreMap

LibreMap is maintained by [André](https://github.com/andrenarchy) and [Nico](https://github.com/nicoechaniz). There is a **[mailing list](http://lists.libremap.net/mailman/listinfo/discussion)** for questions and discussions about LibreMap, so feel free to drop a line there!

LibreMap is a **scalable**, **global** and **decentralized** router database and map visualization for community networks, such as guifi, Altermundi, FunkFeuer, ninux, freifunk, Commotion... It emerged around the [is4cwn](http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/) by merging the maps of [AlterMap](https://colectivo.altermundi.net/projects/altermap) (Altermundi) and [OpenWiFiMap](https://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-html5) (freifunk).

###Twitter Citymaps Kiezatlas Anniversary

This plugin simply places all publicly geo-coded results to a user-defined Twitter Search API Request on a mobile-compatible citymap with geographic-bitmaps/tiles by Mapbox based on OpenStreetMap.

This plugin assembles cool tools, namely Leaflet and DeepaMehta 4, to be used by kiezatlas@sozkult.de. It is a birthday present for the tenth anniversary of the Kiezatlas-Project which is mapping neighbourhoods with bitmaps since 2003.
